## Overview
Codes for running the network model with spatial connectivity to study how network structure affects local and global temporal dynamics.

Please cite this reference when you use this code for a scientific publication.

- act_gen: the function that simulates the network (import from activity_generator.py)
- run_ac.py: the script for simulating the network and computing autocorrelations.
- run_cc.py: the script for simulating the network and computing cross-correlations.

Available connectivity structures for the network (conn_type variable):
- 'local': Moore neighborhood
- 'random': random connectivity
- 'random_spR' (e.g., 'random_sp2'): 8 random connections within the radius R


## Dependencies
- Python >= 3.7.1
